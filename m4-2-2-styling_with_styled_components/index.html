    /*
    💡 NOTE: read the code before getting started so you understand how the app works.
    The <App /> component is tracking in component state a list of heroes on the one hand,
    and the id of the currently selected hero on the other. You can change the currently
    selected hero by clicking on the cards.

    PROBLEM 1 - Set up the styled component:
    Below these instructions there is a `StyledHero` styled component. Replace the div.hero
    inside <Hero /> with this styled component. To the current props of `className` and
    `onClick`, add a third one: `selected`. Pass the module's selected parameter as it's value.
    This way the styled component can know whether a given hero is selected or not.

    PROBLEM 2 - Add CSS to the styled component:
    At the bottom of the src/styles/index.css stylesheet you have a few styles that are commented out.
    Bring them over to the StyledHero component. You won't need the `.hero` selector in the CSS of
    the styled component. Make the look of the hero card match that of the design-file.png image
    inside the src folder.

    PROBLEM 3 - Make some styles dynamic:
    The styled component is being passed the `selected` prop. Use this inside the CSS so that the
    currently clicked hero has some different styling, like a border of a different color, or a
    different font size. Take ideas from the design-file.png or use your imagination!

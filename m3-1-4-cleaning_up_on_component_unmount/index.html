    💡 NOTE: The starter code is broken and full of memory leaks (unnecessary background activity that accumulates,
    causing the browser to consume more and more memory as time goes by): as soon as we start working on problems 2 and 3
    you will need to **refresh your web view manually** whenever you update your code. You can see how to do this
    in the refresh.png image in the src folder. LET'S FIX THIS!

    PROBLEM 1 - Clean up the first effect inside <Bulb />:
    Print "Bulb about to unmount" to the console and test the result by toggling the bulb on and off.

    PROBLEM 2 - ❗ Uncomment the second effect inside <Bulb />:
    This effect is out of control! A fresh listener is added to the DOM whenever we toggle the <Bulb />.
    Experience this bug by toggling the <Bulb /> on and off multiple times and then clicking anywhere on the web view.
    You should see "The window was clicked while the lights were on!" printed to the console multiple times.
    To fix this, you must remove the listener each time <Bulb /> unmounts by invoking `window.removeEventListener`
    and passing it event ("click") and the listener as its arguments.

    PROBLEM 3 - ❗ Uncomment the third effect inside <Bulb />:
    This effect is also out of control!! Whenever we toggle the <Bulb />, a fresh setInterval is added to the DOM,
    even if one is already there. Experience this bug by toggling the <Bulb /> on and off multiple times and then
    looking at the console. You should see "Another second has elapsed with the lights on..." printing rapidly.
    And when the <Bulb /> is unmounted, this message shouldn't print at all, but it keeps printing.
    To fix this, invoke `clearInterval` and pass the interval as its argument to ensure the setInterval
    is removed each time <Bulb /> unmounts.
